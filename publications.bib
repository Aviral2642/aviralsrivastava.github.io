Lattice-based encryption begins with the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Learning With Errors (LWE) difficulties. We then compare lattice-based encryption to RSA and elliptic curve cryptography and discuss its pros and cons. Finally, we introduce "Lattice-based secure data aggregation" for IoT and cloud systems. Lattice-based cryptography ensures data confidentiality and integrity during aggregation. We discuss data encryption, aggregation, and decryption, as well as implementation on resource-constrained devices. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm's performance and security against other data aggregation algorithms. Our method provides good security against attacks, efficient computations, and low memory requirements. We also discuss the approach's drawbacks and future research. We introduce lattice-based cryptography, its uses in IoT and cloud security, and a new algorithm for secure data aggregation. In privacy-and security-sensitive IoT and cloud systems, the proposed method could be widely adopted.},

	abstract = {As the complexity of the digital landscape evolves, so does the sophistication of cyber threats, necessitating advanced cybersecurity measures. Despite significant strides in threat detection and response using machine learning and deep learning techniques, these systems grapple with high false positive rates, limited adaptability to evolving threats, and computational inefficiency in real -time data processing. This study proposes to delve into the potential of Neuromorphic Computing (NC) to address these challenges. Inspired by the human brain's principles, NC offers rapid, efficient information processing through S piking Neural Networks (SNNs) and other brain-inspired architectures. The study hypothesizes that integrating NC into cyber defence could enhance threat detection, response times, and adaptability, thereby bolstering cybersecurity systems' resilience. However, the implementation of NC in cybersecurity is fraught with challenges, including scalability, compatibility with existing infrastructures, and the creation of secure, robust neuromorphic systems. This study elucidates these challenges, proposes potential solutions, and highlights future research directions in this promising field. With focused research and development, NC could revolutionize cybersecurity, enhancing the defence mechanisms of the digital ecosystems against the relentless onslaught of cyber threats. The study analyses that the incorporation of NC into cybersecurity is not only feasible but also necessary in increasingly digital world.},

However, even before the most recent revelations on the concept of Big Data, the vast volumes of data that various analytical firms have collected, kept, and have sparked intrigue. Despite the fact that the security industry is currently one of the primary sectors that huge data for safety objectives, there is a paucity of research that plans foundational systems and provides security requirements for large data execution in security. Unfortunately, electronic attacks, which are the result of the increased reliance on technology, are now a phenomenon with which must be confronted. It is employed in a range of industries, including medical services, security, and webbased entertainment, since it enables speedy and intelligent Big Data solutions. The daily use of media communications services and the internet, electronic devices, Visas, and other similar activities generate large volumes of data that can be classified to facilitate interactions that result in improved decisions and strategic business moves. As innovation has become more complex, the sorts of malware in these breaches have developed and become more complex. Consequently, the goal of the study was to apply big data to the security industry, a novel topic. Due to the structure's adaptability, few defects are produced. These defects put the data at danger and result in assaults. In this work, many sorts of vulnerabilities and potential strategies to mitigate or eradicate them are discussed.},

Intrusion detection plays a major role in protecting smart city systems against cyber-attacks and threats. Deep learning (DL) techniques, namely recurrent neural networks (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were employed for analyzing the network traffic data. The model was trained by labelled dataset, where network traffic instance was categorized as either intrusive or normal. This study proposes a novel automated Intrusion Detection and Classification design using Binary Metaheuristics with Deep Learning (AIDC-BMDL) techniques on S mart Cities. The AIDC-BMDL technique makes use of metaheuristic feature selection and DL based classification process. For the election of optimal features in the intrusion data, the AIDC-BMDL technique uses binary gray wolf optimizer (BGWO) algorithm. Besides, the AIDC-BMDL technique exploits S tacked Autoencoder (S AE) model for the effectual recognition and classification of the intrusions in the smart city environment. The simulation results illustrated the ability of the AIDC-BMDL technique to accurately identify intrusions in smart city environments. The AIDC-BMDL technique gained maximum performance, pointing out the significance of improving the security of smart cities.},

	abstract = {The tremendous growth of internet technology has drastically improved the large amount of connected devices. To secure network infrastructure from the damage that cyberattacks might cause, this has made an enormous attack surface that needs the deployment of practical and effective countermeasures. In the contemporary era of active network transmission and throughput, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in ensuring secure network resource and data from outside invasion. In recent times, IDS becomes an essential tool to enhance the efficiency and flexibility for unpredictable and unexpected invasions of the network. Deep learning (DL) is a well-known and essential method to resolve challenges and could learn rich features of massive information. Therefore, the study focuses on the design and development of the Cauchy Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning for Cloud Enabled IDS (CGOA-DLCIDS) technique. The presented CGOA-DLCIDS method aims to recognize the presence of intrusions in the cloud platform. To achieve this, the CGOA-DLCIDS technique performs feature subset election by CGOA which reduces the feature subset and enhances the intrusion detection rate. Next, the CGOA-DLCIDS technique employs attention based long short-term memory (ALSTM) module for automated and accurate intrusion detection and classification. The simulations analysis of the CGOA-DLCIDS method on benchmark dataset highlighted the increasing results compared to recent IDS approaches.},

Recently, deep learning architectures have been implemented, particularly in the interpretation of EEG readings and the knowledge it may impart about mental processes, thanks to the availability of huge EEG data sets and advancements in deep learning. In order to find useful data for brain classification and neuroimaging, Various Analytical Techniques utilized in EEG investigations have turned to machine learning. This research study combines sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) with a post-processing system, which is comprised of a linear system model dependent on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method as a unique data categorization framework. To boost classification precision, it is to prune datasets of superfluous characteristics. The Q-Learning method is used to built on reinforcement learning to reduce the overall number of features and have obtained the resulting accuracy. Evidence of this strategy leading to better classification performance is shown by experiments on both simulated and actual data. The PSO method provides a metaheuristic strategy for estimating the linear model's parameters. Using publicly available datasets, the suggested methodology is verified; When contrasted to current best practices, the results are favorable. With some adjustments to the input characteristics, hidden neurons, and output classes, the system may be utilized to address any data categorization problem.},

CC is a method of providing online consumers with access to virtualized, dynamically scaled resources. The importance of safety in this on-demand CC cannot be overstated. That's why the authors of this study are presenting a new method of cloud intrusion detection using fuzzy rules. The IDFRC method can monitor the distributed CC platform for intrusions and protect it from any dangers. Each client has their own unique IDS instance installed, with its own dedicated controller. In order to better detect and categorize intrusions, the authors of this piece provide the improved intrusion detection using Fuzzy Rule-based Classifier (IDFRC) model for use in the cloud. The proposed ID-FRC paradigm seeks to distinguish between malicious and benign cloud-based data flows. The improved results of the suggested method are analyzed by a comprehensive simulation study. A hybrid intelligent fruit fly optimization algorithm (HFOA) is used to fine-tune the FRC model's parameters. The FRC is a powerful paradigm in pattern recognition that provides useful results by the incorporation of language labels into the rules' antecedents. The KDD99 and NSL-KDD dataset is utilized to evaluate the suggested approach. Improvements of the current method over recent state-of-the-art methods were guaranteed by a simulation study of the IDFRC model.

In the IFDIAD-SD method, fuzzy min-max normalization is used to scale the input data. For FDIA detection and classification, convolutional neural network with autoencoder (CNN-AE) method is applied. At final stage, the multiverse optimization (MVO) technique is used to optimally select the parameter values of the CNN-AE model.

	abstract = {The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) is used to describe the collection of data and the connectivity of items to the web that requires little to no human interaction. The IoT is a network of interconnected devices that can collect and disseminate information. Increased security and privacy worries accompany the launch of new devices due to the proliferation of Internet connections and the development of cutting-edge technology like the IoT. These days, the IoT is used everywhere, but especially in logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare. While these emerging IoT applications greatly enhance the usefulness of smart objects, they also present new security risks. Because of this, adapting existing intrusion detection systems (IDS ) for use with IoT networks is a topic of intense study. Many IDS experts have found success with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. By combining deep extraction through the Convolutional autoencoder with deep learning to identify the best features, this work delivers an improved IDS that can be used for anomaly detection. Improves to the deep learning approach include an evaluation of hyperparameter effectiveness, a stage of feature pruning using an autoencoder neural network, and an examination of the sturdiness of the most effective deep neural networks for circumstances exaggerated by Gaussian noise over some of the features in question. Despite the noise, the results show that the formed IoT dataset is useful for anomaly detection with deep learning methods.},

	abstract = {Governments throughout the world are encouraging the use of "smart city" technologies to improve urban residents' day-to-day experiences. In order to improve services like healthcare, electricity distribution, water purification, traffic management, etc., smart cities implement internet-connected technologies. The proliferation of connected gadgets has led to an increase in botnet assaults based on the IoT. The term IoT is used to describe a system of computers that are linked together that may be used for a wide variety of tasks, from environmental monitoring to on-demand power switching and beyond. Many Internets of Things gadgets are inherently disparate, update at irregular intervals, and hide in plain sight on a private or company network. The safety and confidentiality issues surrounding the Internet of Things that need to be addressed in both academic and practical settings. This research study proposes a federated-based solution to botnet attack detection utilizing on-device decentralized traffic data and a deep learning (DL) model. The proposed federated method addresses privacy concerns by preventing data from leaving the network's edge on the device. Instead, the edge layer is used to do the DL calculation, which has the extra benefit of being closer to the source of the data. Many tests are run on newly made public test data sets for deep learning models. Additionally, the sets of data are presented for examination and understanding. The recommended DL model achieved better results than the ML models. Finally, this research shows that the suggested model can detect anomalies with a precision of up to 98\%.},

	abstract = {Increased security complexity and variety come with IoT devices. Existing security solutions generally fail to handle multiple difficulties, particularly in real-time attack detection and response. This research introduces a novel, comprehensive architecture that synergistically incorporates various cutting-edge security measures to protect IoT networks from all cyber threats. The proposed framework incorporates NodeMCU ESP8266-based real-time response, safe boot, hardware-based security modules, and zero trust architecture. It recommends incorporating blockchain for security, real-time logging and monitoring, machine learning-assisted intrusion detection, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) for incident response. For improved malware analysis and threat mitigation, integration of APIs for smooth communication with third-party services such as VirusTotal and Hybrid Analyzer is suggested. This paper also discusses data encryption, updates and patching, identity and access management, risk assessment and threat modelling, incident response and recovery, and privacy. This holistic approach to IoT security provides a robust, flexible, and scalable framework to address the changing threat landscape and growing complexity of IoT ecosystems. The proposed methodology defends IoT networks against sophisticated cyberattacks through careful analysis and empirical validation. In an increasingly interconnected world, this research could be useful for practitioners, academics, and stakeholders aiming to strengthen IoT infrastructure resilience.},

Fields such as Computer Vision, Autonomous Navigation, Natural Language Processing, among others, have experienced transformative breakthroughs. Yet, alongside these advancements, a susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has been unveiled. Machine Learning models, despite their sophistication, can be deceived into making erroneous inferences by insubstantial manipulations in the input, a situation recognized as adversarial attacks. These attacks pose significant limitations to the applicability of AI technology in critical security-conscious sectors. Consequently, fortifying AI systems against such malevolent attempts has emerged as a cardinal component in the evolution of AI. This research paper pivots on devising a model that safeguards against adversarial onslaughts, concurrently equipping users with the tools necessary to cultivate robust models. The long-term goal is not only to enhance the reliability of AI but also to further the responsible and secure use of AI in society.},

	abstract = {In this seminal work, we address the emerging challenges of securing holographic data storage systems (HDSSs), which are poised to revolutionize data storage and retrieval paradigms with unprecedented capacity and energy efﬁciency. As the adoption of HDSS becomes more widespread, ensuring the security and integrity of stored data is of paramount importance. This theoretical paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the security risks associated with HDSS and proposes innovative protection mechanisms to thwart unauthorized access and tampering. Our research begins with a thorough examination of the architecture and principles of holographic data storage, highlighting the unique characteristics that distinguish it from traditional storage systems. We identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities inherent to HDSS, emphasizing the necessity of developing specialized security measures to safeguard the integrity and conﬁdentiality of stored data. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework of advanced protection mechanisms tailored specifically for HDSS. The framework encompasses cutting-edge encryption techniques, robust access control policies, and sophisticated intrusion detection methods that are designed to secure the data throughout its lifecycle in the holographic storage environment. Lastly, we offer a comprehensive discussion on the potential challenges and limitations of implementing these security measures, along with recommendations for future research directions in the ﬁeld of HDSS security. This paper serves as a pivotal reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the uncharted territory of holographic data storage security, ultimately laying the foundation for a new era of secure and efﬁcient data management.},
