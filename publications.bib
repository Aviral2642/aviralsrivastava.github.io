	abstract = {As the complexity of the digital landscape evolves, so does the sophistication of cyber threats, necessitating advanced cybersecurity measures. Despite significant strides in threat detection and response using machine learning and deep learning techniques, these systems grapple with high false positive rates, limited adaptability to evolving threats, and computational inefficiency in real -time data processing. This study proposes to delve into the potential of Neuromorphic Computing (NC) to address these challenges. Inspired by the human brain's principles, NC offers rapid, efficient information processing through S piking Neural Networks (SNNs) and other brain-inspired architectures. The study hypothesizes that integrating NC into cyber defence could enhance threat detection, response times, and adaptability, thereby bolstering cybersecurity systems' resilience. However, the implementation of NC in cybersecurity is fraught with challenges, including scalability, compatibility with existing infrastructures, and the creation of secure, robust neuromorphic systems. This study elucidates these challenges, proposes potential solutions, and highlights future research directions in this promising field. With focused research and development, NC could revolutionize cybersecurity, enhancing the defence mechanisms of the digital ecosystems against the relentless onslaught of cyber threats. The study analyses that the incorporation of NC into cybersecurity is not only feasible but also necessary in increasingly digital world.},

	abstract = {The tremendous growth of internet technology has drastically improved the large amount of connected devices. To secure network infrastructure from the damage that cyberattacks might cause, this has made an enormous attack surface that needs the deployment of practical and effective countermeasures. In the contemporary era of active network transmission and throughput, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in ensuring secure network resource and data from outside invasion. In recent times, IDS becomes an essential tool to enhance the efficiency and flexibility for unpredictable and unexpected invasions of the network. Deep learning (DL) is a well-known and essential method to resolve challenges and could learn rich features of massive information. Therefore, the study focuses on the design and development of the Cauchy Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning for Cloud Enabled IDS (CGOA-DLCIDS) technique. The presented CGOA-DLCIDS method aims to recognize the presence of intrusions in the cloud platform. To achieve this, the CGOA-DLCIDS technique performs feature subset election by CGOA which reduces the feature subset and enhances the intrusion detection rate. Next, the CGOA-DLCIDS technique employs attention based long short-term memory (ALSTM) module for automated and accurate intrusion detection and classification. The simulations analysis of the CGOA-DLCIDS method on benchmark dataset highlighted the increasing results compared to recent IDS approaches.},

	abstract = {Analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data has shown to be a useful tool in the fields of Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and even business. Recently, deep learning architectures have been implemented, particularly in the interpretation of EEG readings and the knowledge it may impart about mental processes, thanks to the availability of huge EEG data sets and advancements in deep learning. In order to find useful data for brain classification and neuroimaging, Various Analytical Techniques utilized in EEG investigations have turned to machine learning. This research study combines sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) with a post-processing system, which is comprised of a linear system model dependent on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method as a unique data categorization framework. To boost classification precision, it is to prune datasets of superfluous characteristics. The Q-Learning method is used to built on reinforcement learning to reduce the overall number of features and have obtained the resulting accuracy. Evidence of this strategy leading to better classification performance is shown by experiments on both simulated and actual data. The PSO method provides a metaheuristic strategy for estimating the linear model's parameters. Using publicly available datasets, the suggested methodology is verified; When contrasted to current best practices, the results are favorable. With some adjustments to the input characteristics, hidden neurons, and output classes, the system may be utilized to address any data categorization problem.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) is a model of distributed computing that makes it possible to access data, applications, and computer infrastructure through the Internet whenever and wherever it is needed. CC is a method of providing online consumers with access to virtualized, dynamically scaled resources. The importance of safety in this on-demand CC cannot be overstated. That's why the authors of this study are presenting a new method of cloud intrusion detection using fuzzy rules. The IDFRC method can monitor the distributed CC platform for intrusions and protect it from any dangers. Each client has their own unique IDS instance installed, with its own dedicated controller. In order to better detect and categorize intrusions, the authors of this piece provide the improved intrusion detection using Fuzzy Rule-based Classifier (IDFRC) model for use in the cloud. The proposed ID-FRC paradigm seeks to distinguish between malicious and benign cloud-based data flows. The improved results of the suggested method are analyzed by a comprehensive simulation study. A hybrid intelligent fruit fly optimization algorithm (HFOA) is used to fine-tune the FRC model's parameters. The FRC is a powerful paradigm in pattern recognition that provides useful results by the incorporation of language labels into the rules' antecedents. The KDD99 and NSL-KDD dataset is utilized to evaluate the suggested approach. Improvements of the current method over recent state-of-the-art methods were guaranteed by a simulation study of the IDFRC model. Maximum detection performance was reported by the model, with an F-score of 98.5 and a reliability of 100\%.},

The IoT is a network of interconnected devices that can collect and disseminate information.

These days, the IoT is used everywhere, but especially in logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare. While these emerging IoT applications greatly enhance the usefulness of smart objects, they also present new security risks. Because of this, adapting existing intrusion detection systems (IDS ) for use with IoT networks is a topic of intense study.

By combining deep extraction through the Convolutional autoencoder with deep learning to identify the best features, this work delivers an improved IDS that can be used for anomaly detection. Improves to the deep learning approach include an evaluation of hyperparameter effectiveness, a stage of feature pruning using an autoencoder neural network, and an examination of the sturdiness of the most effective deep neural networks for circumstances exaggerated by Gaussian noise over some of the features in question.
