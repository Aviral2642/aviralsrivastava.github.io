 abstract = {The rapid surge in digitalization has also increased the necessity for data security. Either in terms of storage, such as databases protected by cryptographic techniques, or in terms of individuals attempting to practice security for assorted reasons. Steganography is the process of concealing useful information within an uninteresting entity, such as an image or video that does not elicit much attention. This study focuses on the deployment of a flutter-based mobile application that enables the secure transfer of steganography-hidden images between users. The employed algorithm is RGB-based and further safeguarded by a key. The paper examines the key generation process as well as the Flutter application in detail and uses cloud-based resources to address common issues such as scalability and accessibility.},
