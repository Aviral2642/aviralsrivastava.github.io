abstract: The rapid surge in digitalization has also increased the necessity for data
  security. Either in terms of storage, such as databases protected by cryptographic
  techniques, or in terms of individuals attempting to practice security for assorted
  reasons. Steganography is the process of concealing useful information within an
  uninteresting entity, such as an image or video that does not elicit much attention.
  This study focuses on the deployment of a flutter-based mobile application that
  enables the secure transfer of steganography-hidden images between users. The employed
  algorithm is RGB-based and further safeguarded by a key. The paper examines the
  key generation process as well as the Flutter application in detail and uses cloud-based
  resources to address common issues such as scalability and accessibility.
