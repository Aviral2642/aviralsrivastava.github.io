abstract: In recent years, a surge of interest has been witnessed in the realms of
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven technologies. Fields such as Computer Vision,
  Autonomous Navigation, Natural Language Processing, among others, have experienced
  transformative breakthroughs. Yet, alongside these advancements, a susceptibility
  to adversarial perturbations has been unveiled. Machine Learning models, despite
  their sophistication, can be deceived into making erroneous inferences by insubstantial
  manipulations in the input, a situation recognized as adversarial attacks. These
  attacks pose significant limitations to the applicability of AI technology in critical
  security-conscious sectors. Consequently, fortifying AI systems against such malevolent
  attempts has emerged as a cardinal component in the evolution of AI. This research
  paper pivots on devising a model that safeguards against adversarial onslaughts,
  concurrently equipping users with the tools necessary to cultivate robust models.
  The long-term goal is not only to enhance the reliability of AI but also to further
  the responsible and secure use of AI in society.
