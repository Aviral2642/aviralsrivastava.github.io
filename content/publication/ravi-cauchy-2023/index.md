abstract: The tremendous growth of internet technology has drastically improved the
  large amount of connected devices. To secure network infrastructure from the damage
  that cyberattacks might cause, this has made an enormous attack surface that needs
  the deployment of practical and effective countermeasures. In the contemporary era
  of active network transmission and throughput, Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
  plays a vital role in ensuring secure network resource and data from outside invasion.
  In recent times, IDS becomes an essential tool to enhance the efficiency and flexibility
  for unpredictable and unexpected invasions of the network. Deep learning (DL) is
  a well-known and essential method to resolve challenges and could learn rich features
  of massive information. Therefore, the study focuses on the design and development
  of the Cauchy Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning for Cloud Enabled
  IDS (CGOA-DLCIDS) technique. The presented CGOA-DLCIDS method aims to recognize
  the presence of intrusions in the cloud platform. To achieve this, the CGOA-DLCIDS
  technique performs feature subset election by CGOA which reduces the feature subset
  and enhances the intrusion detection rate. Next, the CGOA-DLCIDS technique employs
  attention based long short-term memory (ALSTM) module for automated and accurate
  intrusion detection and classification. The simulations analysis of the CGOA-DLCIDS
  method on benchmark dataset highlighted the increasing results compared to recent
  IDS approaches.
