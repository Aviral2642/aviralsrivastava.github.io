abstract: With the dramatic increase of interconnected devices in smart cities, ensuring
  the integrity and security of the basic infrastructure has become a major concern.
  Intrusion detection plays a major role in protecting smart city systems against
  cyber-attacks and threats. Deep learning (DL) techniques, namely recurrent neural
  networks (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were employed for analyzing
  the network traffic data. The model was trained by labelled dataset, where network
  traffic instance was categorized as either intrusive or normal. This study proposes
  a novel automated Intrusion Detection and Classification design using Binary Metaheuristics
  with Deep Learning (AIDC-BMDL) techniques on S mart Cities. The AIDC-BMDL technique
  makes use of metaheuristic feature selection and DL based classification process.
  For the election of optimal features in the intrusion data, the AIDC-BMDL technique
  uses binary gray wolf optimizer (BGWO) algorithm. Besides, the AIDC-BMDL technique
  exploits S tacked Autoencoder (S AE) model for the effectual recognition and classification
  of the intrusions in the smart city environment. The simulation results illustrated
  the ability of the AIDC-BMDL technique to accurately identify intrusions in smart
  city environments. The AIDC-BMDL technique gained maximum performance, pointing
  out the significance of improving the security of smart cities.
