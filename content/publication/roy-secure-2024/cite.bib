 abstract = {In this seminal work, we address the emerging challenges of securing holographic data storage systems (HDSSs), which are poised to revolutionize data storage and retrieval paradigms with unprecedented capacity and energy efﬁciency. As the adoption of HDSS becomes more widespread, ensuring the security and integrity of stored data is of paramount importance. This theoretical paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the security risks associated with HDSS and proposes innovative protection mechanisms to thwart unauthorized access and tampering. Our research begins with a thorough examination of the architecture and principles of holographic data storage, highlighting the unique characteristics that distinguish it from traditional storage systems. We identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities inherent to HDSS, emphasizing the necessity of developing specialized security measures to safeguard the integrity and conﬁdentiality of stored data. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework of advanced protection mechanisms tailored specifically for HDSS. The framework encompasses cutting-edge encryption techniques, robust access control policies, and sophisticated intrusion detection methods that are designed to secure the data throughout its lifecycle in the holographic storage environment. Lastly, we offer a comprehensive discussion on the potential challenges and limitations of implementing these security measures, along with recommendations for future research directions in the ﬁeld of HDSS security. This paper serves as a pivotal reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the uncharted territory of holographic data storage security, ultimately laying the foundation for a new era of secure and efﬁcient data management.},
