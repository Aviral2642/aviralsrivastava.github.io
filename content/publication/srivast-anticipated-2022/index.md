abstract: Abstract Machine learning and data mining techniques are utiized for enhancement
  of the security of any network. Researchers used machine learning for pattern detection,
  anomaly detection, dynamic policy setting, etc. The methods allow the program to
  learn from data and make decisions without human intervention, consuming a huge
  training period and computation power. This paper discusses a novel technique to
  predict an upcoming attack in a network based on several data parameters. The dataset
  is continuous in real-time implementation. The proposed model comprises dataset
  pre-processing, and training, followed by the testing phase. Based on the results
  of the testing phase, the best model is selected using which, event class which
  may lead to an attack is extracted. The event statistics are used for attack prediction.
  Implementation of the proposed architecture is evaluated against accuracy, precision,
  recall, and F1 score for processed data.
