Machine learning and data mining techniques are utiized for enhancement of the security of any network. Researchers used machine learning for pattern detection, anomaly detection, dynamic policy setting, etc. The methods allow the program to learn from data and make decisions without human intervention, consuming a huge training period and computation power. This paper discusses a novel technique to predict an upcoming attack in a network based on several data parameters. The dataset is continuous in real-time implementation. The proposed model comprises dataset pre-processing, and training, followed by the testing phase. Based on the results of the testing phase, the best model is selected using which, event class which may lead to an attack is extracted. The event statistics are used for attack prediction. Implementation of the proposed architecture is evaluated against accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for processed data.},
