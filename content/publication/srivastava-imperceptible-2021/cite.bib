 abstract = {In recent times new Antivirus software are using Machine learning to make their detection even more sophisticated. Machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning along with data analysis have made it possible to implement a dynamic analysis procedure to detect any malware. So in this paper, we will be introducing an algorithm by which we will not only be able to bypass signature-based detection by ‘rephrasing the code’ using CLP, along with the behavioral-based analysis, which are the most prominent methods for the job, but also will be attempting to go around the real-time monitoring and try to be undetected during the forensic investigation by clearing code footprint.},
