 abstract = {In the digital age, state-sponsored cyber operations have emerged as a potent instrument of statecraft. This study provides a comprehensive temporal analysis of such operations, illuminating the patterns and trends that have shaped this clandestine landscape from 2005 to 2022. Using a unique dataset compiled from the Council on Foreign Relations, we investigate the frequency, types, sponsors, and targets of these operations. Our findings reveal an escalating trend in cyber operations, dominated by a few key state actors and increasingly directed towards governmental and private sector targets. The dominant operation type is espionage, underscoring the importance of information in digital warfare. This study contributes to the understanding of state behavior in cyberspace and calls for further research and policy development in this critical domain of global security.},
