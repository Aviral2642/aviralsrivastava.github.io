abstract: In the digital age, state-sponsored cyber operations have emerged as a potent
  instrument of statecraft. This study provides a comprehensive temporal analysis
  of such operations, illuminating the patterns and trends that have shaped this clandestine
  landscape from 2005 to 2022. Using a unique dataset compiled from the Council on
  Foreign Relations, we investigate the frequency, types, sponsors, and targets of
  these operations. Our findings reveal an escalating trend in cyber operations, dominated
  by a few key state actors and increasingly directed towards governmental and private
  sector targets. The dominant operation type is espionage, underscoring the importance
  of information in digital warfare. This study contributes to the understanding of
  state behavior in cyberspace and calls for further research and policy development
  in this critical domain of global security.
