abstract: Android mobile applications and devices can be extremely utilized and employed
  in industry and smart cities. Malware recognition is an efficient and powerful method
  for assurance security of Android schemes, mainly for industrial platforms and smart
  cities. In recent times, research utilizing machine learning (ML)-based approaches
  for Android malware recognition enhanced quickly. However, one of the performed
  methods to accomplish feature selection and analysis, so-called feature engineering
  is labour-intensive and depends on artificial knowledge. Therefore, this study presents
  a Hybrid Multimodal Machine Learning Driven Android Malware Recognition and Classification
  (HM3-AMRC) model. The proposed HM3-AMRC technique recognizes and categorizes the
  Android malware accurately and efficiently. In the presented HM3-AMRC technique,
  initial phase of data preprocessing is performed. Next, the classification process
  takes place using three ML techniques such as gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT),
  extreme learning machine (ELM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Moreover, Bayesian
  optimization (BO) technique is employed for optimal parameter selection of the ML
  approaches. The stimulation analysis of the HM3-AMRC method is tested on Android
  malware dataset. Extensive comparison analysis highlighted the betterment of the
  HM3-AMRC method over existing techniques.
