abstract: Increased security complexity and variety come with IoT devices. Existing
  security solutions generally fail to handle multiple difficulties, particularly
  in real-time attack detection and response. This research introduces a novel, comprehensive
  architecture that synergistically incorporates various cutting-edge security measures
  to protect IoT networks from all cyber threats. The proposed framework incorporates
  NodeMCU ESP8266-based real-time response, safe boot, hardware-based security modules,
  and zero trust architecture. It recommends incorporating blockchain for security,
  real-time logging and monitoring, machine learning-assisted intrusion detection,
  and indicators of compromise (IOCs) for incident response. For improved malware
  analysis and threat mitigation, integration of APIs for smooth communication with
  third-party services such as VirusTotal and Hybrid Analyzer is suggested. This paper
  also discusses data encryption, updates and patching, identity and access management,
  risk assessment and threat modelling, incident response and recovery, and privacy.
  This holistic approach to IoT security provides a robust, flexible, and scalable
  framework to address the changing threat landscape and growing complexity of IoT
  ecosystems. The proposed methodology defends IoT networks against sophisticated
  cyberattacks through careful analysis and empirical validation. In an increasingly
  interconnected world, this research could be useful for practitioners, academics,
  and stakeholders aiming to strengthen IoT infrastructure resilience.
