abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) cites the usage of classical Internet
  of Things (IoT) in different applications and industrial fields. Smart grids, smart
  homes, supply chain management, connected cars, and smart cities are the different
  applications of IIoT. But this system is widely targeted by cybercriminals. Big
  data analytics and Deep learning (DL) have considerable potential in developing
  and designing strong security systems for IIoT networks. This manuscript introduces
  Multimodal Sensor Data Fusion based Cyberattack Detection with glow worm swarm optimization
  (MSDF-CDGSO) technique in IIoT environment. The MSDF-CDGSO technique examines the
  IIoT data for identifying the existence of cyberattacks in the IIoT environment.
  In the presented MSDF-CDGSO technique, the IIoT devices collect data from different
  devices and fused them together. At the preliminary stage, the MSDF-CDGSO technique
  preprocesses the input data to scale them properly. For cyberattack detection, the
  MSDF-CDGSO technique uses classspecific cost regulation extreme learning machine
  (CCR-ELM) model. Finally, the GSO method is exploited to adjust the parameter values
  of the CCR-ELM algorithm. The simulation result analysis of the MSDF-CDGSO method
  is investigated on benchmark database. A widespread comparison results highlighted
  that the MSDF-CDGSO technique reaches improved cybersecurity in the IIoT environment.
