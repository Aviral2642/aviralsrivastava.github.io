abstract: This chapter introduces lattice-based cryptography for IoT and cloud security.
  Lattice-based encryption begins with the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Learning
  With Errors (LWE) difficulties. We then compare lattice-based encryption to RSA
  and elliptic curve cryptography and discuss its pros and cons. Finally, we introduce
  \"Lattice-based secure data aggregation\" for IoT and cloud systems. Lattice-based
  cryptography ensures data confidentiality and integrity during aggregation. We discuss
  data encryption, aggregation, and decryption, as well as implementation on resource-constrained
  devices. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm's performance and security against other
  data aggregation algorithms. Our method provides good security against attacks,
  efficient computations, and low memory requirements. We also discuss the approach's
  drawbacks and future research. We introduce lattice-based cryptography, its uses
  in IoT and cloud security, and a new algorithm for secure data aggregation. In privacy-and
  security-sensitive IoT and cloud systems, the proposed method could be widely adopted.
