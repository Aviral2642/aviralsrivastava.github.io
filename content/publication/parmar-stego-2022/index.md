abstract: With the fast-growing digital world in the pandemic scenario, there is a
  concern for data security when it crosses through various unbarred communication
  media. The data, the most useful way of communication despite being vulnerable to
  security breaches. Although there are a lot of other techniques suggested to keep
  this type of data in various ways, the potential for exploitation remains constant.
  S teganography, where the user embeds his secret message in a file so that ownership
  of intellectual property can be claimed to ensure the integrity of the content.
  The article discusses building a flutter application for cell phones that implement
  image steganography that follows an RGB algorithm. The algorithm highlights a new
  symmetric encryption methodology where in complex determinant calculations and random
  matrix development is used for key generation. The application codes the desired
  message using the RGB algorithm into the specified image from the gallery after
  clicking on the encode button displayed on the screen. After communication, the
  same application can be used to decode the message from the picture; if the picture
  contains a secret message that is coded using the same algorithm used for decoding
  methods, hence ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
