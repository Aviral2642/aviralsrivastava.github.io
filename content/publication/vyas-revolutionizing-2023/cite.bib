 abstract = {The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) is used to describe the collection of data and the connectivity of items to the web that requires little to no human interaction. The IoT is a network of interconnected devices that can collect and disseminate information. Increased security and privacy worries accompany the launch of new devices due to the proliferation of Internet connections and the development of cutting-edge technology like the IoT. These days, the IoT is used everywhere, but especially in logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare. While these emerging IoT applications greatly enhance the usefulness of smart objects, they also present new security risks. Because of this, adapting existing intrusion detection systems (IDS ) for use with IoT networks is a topic of intense study. Many IDS experts have found success with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. By combining deep extraction through the Convolutional autoencoder with deep learning to identify the best features, this work delivers an improved IDS that can be used for anomaly detection. Improves to the deep learning approach include an evaluation of hyperparameter effectiveness, a stage of feature pruning using an autoencoder neural network, and an examination of the sturdiness of the most effective deep neural networks for circumstances exaggerated by Gaussian noise over some of the features in question. Despite the noise, the results show that the formed IoT dataset is useful for anomaly detection with deep learning methods.},
