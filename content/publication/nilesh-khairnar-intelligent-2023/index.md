abstract: The modern power system has developed into a cyber-physical system with
  the incorporation of smart meters, Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), extensive area
  monitoring, control systems and substation automation. False Data Injection Attack
  (FDIA) has gained popularity in Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS). In particular,
  there is an increasing need to examine the possible behavior of adversaries to enhance
  the cybersecurity nature of CPPS but the FDIA model is frequently built on the effects
  of attacker or the effect of attack. Therefore, this study presents an Intelligent
  False Data Injection Attack Detection using Soft Computing (IFDIAD-SD) technique
  in the CPPS environment. The aim of the IFDIAD-SD technique is the effectual recognition
  and classification of FDIAs in the CPPS environment. In the IFDIAD-SD method, fuzzy
  min-max normalization is used to scale the input data. For FDIA detection and classification,
  convolutional neural network with autoencoder (CNN-AE) method is applied. At final
  stage, the multiverse optimization (MVO) technique is used to optimally select the
  parameter values of the CNN-AE model. A series of experiments were implemented for
  identifying the superior performance of the IFDIAD-SD technique. The comprehensive
  comparative result analysis revealed the supremacy of the IFDIAD-SD method when
  compared to other models.
